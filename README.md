## Project Description

Our Vision: 

Find your perfect home away from home with just a few clicks. Affordable housing at your fingertips - search now!

We provide the ultimate solution for hostelers and young working professionals looking for accommodation in new areas. Our app is designed to make your housing search as seamless and stress-free as possible, allowing you to focus on your work or studies without worrying about where you're going to stay.
Target Customers: Students, & Young Working Professionals. 

What sets us apart from our competitors? For starters, our app is incredibly user-friendly and easy to navigate, even if you're not tech-savvy. We've worked hard to create an intuitive interface that lets you find what you're looking for with just a few clicks.

We offer a robust database of housing options that are both affordable and comfortable. Young people often have limited budgets, so we've made it a priority to offer options that won't break the bank. But we also know that you want to feel at home in your new place, so we've made sure to include amenities that will make your stay enjoyable and comfortable.

The Problem :  <!---
- Many people don't know the benefits of doing aquaponics or doing fish farm cultivation.
- Even if some realise the benefits, they don't know of proper good resources to actually start the cultivation
- Once you start the cultivation, the current methods takes time and is prone to trial and error during the initial days
- You would need to manually go and check every often to ensure that the fishes are in good health  
- Even once the fishes are in good health, the seller don't know how exactly to market them to potential customers--->
  Road Map : 
  
  
 Future Plans :
  - Virtual Tours : By adding virtual tours to your app, you can provide users with a 360-degree view of the accommodations they're interested in, allowing them to
  explore every corner of the room or property.
  - In-App Texting :  Owners and Interested parties can communicate seamlessly with each other app. 
  - Local events and activities : A community page to publicise local events.
