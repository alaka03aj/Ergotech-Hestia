## Project Description

Our Vision: Promote fish farm cultivation using a sustainable manner while earning profit

Target Customers: Students, & Young Working Professionals

The Problem :  
- Many people don't know the benefits of doing aquaponics or doing fish farm cultivation.
- Even if some realise the benefits, they don't know of proper good resources to actually start the cultivation
- Once you start the cultivation, the current methods takes time and is prone to trial and error during the initial days
- You would need to manually go and check every often to ensure that the fishes are in good health  
- Even once the fishes are in good health, the seller don't know how exactly to market them to potential customers

 
# Our Solution
